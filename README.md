### Repository Name: **Arduino-Course-Projects**

#### Repository Description:
This repository contains all code and exercises from the Arduino course. Projects are developed using the Arduino Cloud platform and Autodesk Fusion 360 for simulation, without physical hardware. All sketches and libraries used in the course are organized for easy reference and reuse.

# Arduino-Course-Projects

This repository is a collection of all Arduino sketches and course exercises developed using the Arduino Cloud platform. The course focuses on learning Arduino programming through cloud-based tools and simulations. No physical hardware is required for most exercises.

## Course Overview
- Tools used: Arduino Cloud, Autodesk Fusion 360, Arduino Web Editor.
- Projects: Simple sketches, IoT-based simulations, and other projects.
- All examples are created with cloud-based resources provided by the course.

## Structure

- `/src/` : Contains all Arduino sketches (in `.ino` format).
- `/libraries/` : Libraries included or required by each project.
- `/docs/` : Documentation or course-related notes.
- `/examples/` : Course-specific examples such as the Blink LED.

## Initial Project

### Blink LED Example

**Description**: This sketch blinks the built-in LED on the virtual Arduino Uno board in the cloud editor.

**How to Run**: 
1. Open Arduino Web Editor in the cloud.
2. Compile and upload the Blink sketch to simulate the LED behavior.
3. No physical board is required.

**Code Structure**: 
```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);  // Configure pin for LED
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // Wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // Wait for 1 second
}
```

## How to Use This Repository

### Workflow:
1. **Arduino Cloud Setup**: 
   - Log into [Arduino Cloud](https://app.arduino.cc/).
   - Access your cloud projects via [Arduino Sketches](https://app.arduino.cc/sketches/).
   
2. **Autodesk Fusion 360**: 
   - Use Autodesk Fusion 360 for simulations if necessary.
   - Export designs or results from Fusion 360 and store them under the `/docs` or `/projects` folder.
   
3. **Organizing Code**:
   - Store your course-related code in `/src/` for easy access.
   - Example sketches (like Blink) should be saved under `/examples/` with the file structure.

## Tools Used

- **Arduino Web Editor**: To write and upload code directly in the cloud.
- **Arduino Cloud**: For project management and storing sketches.
- **Autodesk Fusion 360**: Used for any CAD design or hardware simulations related to the course.

#### Why No Tinkercad Mentioned:
Since you’re not using Tinkercad, I’ve removed any references to it and made sure to focus only on the tools you've mentioned: Arduino Cloud and Autodesk Fusion 360.

#### GitHub Integration:
You can use GitHub as a backup for source control, but the integration can be manual, meaning you upload your code from the cloud editor to this repository for tracking your progress.

This README is now specifically relevant to your current tools and learning platform!
