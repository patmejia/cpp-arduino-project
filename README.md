# **Basic LED Blink Setup with 220立 Resistor for Initial Circuit Testing**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates a simple **LED blink circuit** using an **Arduino Uno R3** and a **220立 resistor** to ensure safe current flow through the LED. The project was carried out using **Arduino Cloud**, **Arduino Web Editor**, **Tinkercad**, and the **Elegoo Uno R3** kit for physical testing. This project serves as an initial circuit test to ensure proper setup, component connection, and code execution.

## **Circuit Setup**

1. **LED Connections**:
   - **Anode (long leg)**: Connected to **E12** on the breadboard.
   - **Cathode (short leg)**: Shared with **E13** on the breadboard and connected to the **GND** of the Arduino using a **black wire**.

2. **Resistor (220立)**:
   - One leg in **D12** (shared with the anode).
   - The other leg in **D1** on the breadboard.

3. **Green Signal Wire**:
   - Connect from **D1** on the breadboard to **Digital Pin 13** on the Arduino to control the LED.
