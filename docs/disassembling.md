# Disassembling Your Arduino Circuit

This guide walks you through safely disassembling your Arduino circuit and storing components properly.

### **Step 1: Turn Off Power**
- **Best Practice**: Ensure no active power supply before touching components to avoid electrical shock or damage.
1. Unplug the **USB cable** from your **computer** and **Arduino board**.
   - This cuts power to the board and circuit.

### **Step 2: Remove the Cables**
- **Best Practice**: Remove cables gently to avoid damaging wires or the breadboard.
1. **Disconnect the Black Ground Wire** (GND):
   - Unplug the **black wire** from the breadboard and **GND pin**.
2. **Disconnect the Green Signal Wire**:
   - Unplug the **green wire** from **pin 13** on the Arduino and breadboard.

### **Step 3: Remove the LED and Resistor**
- **Best Practice**: Gently pull components to avoid bending their legs.
1. **Remove the LED**:
   - Gently pull the **LED** from the breadboard by its legs.
   - Be careful not to bend the **anode** or **cathode**.
2. **Remove the Resistor**:
   - Gently pull the **220Î© resistor** from the breadboard.

### **Step 4: Store Components Properly**
- **Best Practice**: Store components safely to avoid loss or damage.
1. **Store the LED**:
   - Place the **LED** in a small compartment in your kit.
2. **Store the Resistor**:
   - Place the **resistor** in its labeled slot or bag.
3. **Store the Wires**:
   - Neatly coil wires and store to avoid tangling.

### **Step 5: Pack the Arduino Board**
- **Best Practice**: Avoid exposing the board to dust or pressure.
1. Place the **Arduino board** in its **original box** or protective case.
   - Ensure the **pins** and **ports** are covered and the board is stored away from heavy objects.

---

### **Step 6: Store the Breadboard**
- **Best Practice**: Keep your breadboard clean and organized.
1. Detach the **breadboard** from your workspace.
   - Store it flat to prevent dust or debris from entering the contacts.

---

### **Step 7: Store the USB Cable**
- **Best Practice**: Store cables neatly.
1. **Coil the USB Cable**:
   - Neatly coil the USB cable and store in a drawer or kit.

### **Final Notes**
- **Label Everything**: If you have multiple components, label them for easy identification next time.
- **Clean the Workspace**: Wipe down your workspace to ensure no small components are left behind.
